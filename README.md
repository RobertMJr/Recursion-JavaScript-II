### Description
Recursion occurs when a thing is defined in terms of itself or of its type. 
Recursion in computer programming is exemplified when a function is defined in terms of simpler, often smaller versions of itself. 
The solution to the problem is then devised by combining the solutions obtained from the simpler versions of the problem.
